A rewarding agent that converts various loyalty points from apps into $Reward, a unified reward token.

Reward enables users to convert reward points from platforms like **Flipkart SuperCoins and Amazon Pay Balance** into **on-chain crypto rewards** using **zkTLS and the Reclaim Protocol**. It is powered by the **Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)** Agent kit.

### **How the Project Works**

1. **User Requests Reward Conversion**

   - The user wants to redeem their Flipkart SuperCoins or Amazon Pay Balance and convert them into cryptocurrency.
   - The system supports multiple reward platforms, but currently, Flipkart and Amazon are integrated.

2. **Generating Proof of Ownership (via Reclaim Protocol)**

   - To ensure authenticity, the user generates a **zk-proof** (zero-knowledge proof) via the **Reclaim Protocol**.
   - This proof is created based on the userâ€™s Flipkart or Amazon account balance, ensuring that the claim is legitimate.
   - A callback URL is provided to receive the proof after generation.

3. **Verifying the Proof**

   - The system verifies the zk-proof using the `verifyProof` function from Reclaim Protocol.
   - If the proof is valid, the platform extracts relevant data such as:
     - **Amount of reward points** (e.g., `500 SuperCoins`)
     - **Userâ€™s wallet address** (to receive converted rewards)

4. **Converting Points to Cryptocurrency**

   - The verified amount is converted into **cryptocurrency** (on the Base Sepolia network for testing).
   - The smart contract function `transfer(address, amount)` is called to send the converted value to the userâ€™s wallet.

5. **Agent and AI Automation**

   - A **Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) AI agent** interacts with users and manages the reward transfer process.
   - The AI agent:
     - Helps users initiate the reclaim proof process.
     - Guides them on redeeming rewards from Flipkart/Amazon.
     - Triggers the proof verification and crypto transfer process.

6. **WebSocket & Express Server for Real-time Processing**
   - The backend runs on **Express.js** for HTTP API endpoints.
   - A **WebSocket server** enables real-time communication with clients (e.g., updates on proof verification and reward transfers).
